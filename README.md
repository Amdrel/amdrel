# Hello! I'm Jamie

I am a fullstack software developer based in California with over 10 years of experience building
performant experiences for the web. I am highly experienced in the backend having maintained APIs
and microservices written with Node.js and Python; but also the frontend as well with React, Next.js
and Angular.

Currently I'm employed as a Senior Software Engineer at [This Dot](https://www.thisdot.co) creating
performant and resilient experiences that users can count on. I've had the opportunity to work on
websites and services from marketing campaign landing pages to online ordering systems.

If you want to see some of what I've done, then feel free to check out my [work
experience](https://www.jamiekuppens.com/experience).

In my free time I am a D&D and RPG nerd that is seemingly incapable of playing anything that doesn't
have pointy ears. I'm currently a very active World of Warcraft player raiding with my guild every
week killing bosses and getting loot.
